# udon
UDON is an unsupervised framework for defining disease subtypes from patient scRNA-seq data. It uses control-normalized pseudobulk expression and sparse NMF to identify stable cell-state perturbations. UDON includes SATAY-UDON for metadata enrichment and SASHIMI-UDON for cohorts with limited controls.
